## Voron V0.1 mod with 3 Z steppers like Trident and same build volume of 120x120x120

#The frame is the same. Well, mostly, what changes:
- one of the two back vertical extrusions is moved behind the horizontal ones.
- the leftover vertical beck extrusion cut to 120mm for bed front extrusion.
- mid-panel moved to the back, needs to be cut in half and trimmed, also cutouts for A/B steppers, alternatively can be printed.
- new motor panel (the best option is to have the PCB 14p connector)
