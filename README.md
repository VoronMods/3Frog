## Voron V0.1 mod with 3 Z steppers like Trident and same build volume of 120x120x120

#The frame is the same. Well, mostly, what changes:
- for bed front extrusion, use MeakerBeam XL 15x15 cube (or cut to 120mm the leftover vertical back extrusion)
- for the 2 bed extrusion, use 7 mm spacer cut out of left over MeakerBeam XL or use 7x 1mm M5 spacers, I've also designed part taht can be use with or w/o spacers.
